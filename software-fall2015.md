Persisting Tweets
=================

Your objective is simple: download Tweets using the Twitter developer APIs and store them in a SQLite database.

This exercise evaluates your technical knowledge and ability to learn and apply new tools. It is intentionally open-ended. We provide some objectives and suggestions, but you are free to tackle the problem as you please.

We recommend setting aside some fixed amount of time to work on this. At the end, make a note of how you would improve the project given more time. Note also which topics you researched and learned for this project. 


Suggested Requirements
----------------------

While it's not necessary to meet all of these requirements, we're interested in seeing how much you can get done (or how and why you did things differently).

* Implement your solution using Python and the Python libraries of your choice.
* Consider using git for source control.
* Design a [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) storage schema for Tweets.
* Use the Twitter [REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) or [Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) to access Tweets.
* Write a script or service that filters Tweets for a trending keyword and collect tweets for some time interval (e.g., 30 minutes).
* Include concise documentation that describes how to run your script or service and explains anything about your approach that you'd like us to know about.

Submit your solution by email or by pushing to a private git repository (e.g., using a free account on [BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.com)) and granting us access. If you use BitBucket, please grant access to [10flow](https://bitbucket.org/10flow/).
